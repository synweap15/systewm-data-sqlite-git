        All the &quot;static&quot; packages contain either native or mixed-mode
        assembly binaries linked statically to the appropriate version of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C++">Visual C++</a>
        runtime.  Typically, these packages are used in cases where customer
        machines may not have the necessary version of the Visual C++ runtime
        installed and it cannot be installed due to limited privileges.
        <br /><br />
        The next step is to identify the version of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">.NET Framework</a>
        being targeted by the application.
        Generally, assembly binaries linked against the

        <b>cannot</b> be loaded by any versions of the .NET Framework prior to
        4.0.

        The final step is to identify the target processor architecture on both
        the development and customer machines.  Generally,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86">x86</a> binaries will work on
        an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X64">x64</a> machine running
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows">Windows</a> (using
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WoW64">WoW64</a>).  However, there
        is a problem when using managed code.  If the executable that starts the
        process consists entirely of managed code, it will run with the native
        processor architecture of the machine, which will be x64 on an x64
        machine.  Later on, this will cause assemblies containing any native
        code compiled for x86 (e.g. the &quot;System.Data.SQLite.dll&quot;
        mixed-mode assembly, the &quot;SQLite.Interop.dll&quot; native interop
        assembly, or the &quot;sqlite3.dll&quot; native library) to fail to
        load, typically resulting in a
        <a href="faq.wiki#q12">BadImageFormatException</a> being thrown.
        <br /><br />
        If the development and customer machines may have different processor
        architectures, more than one binary package may be required.  For this
        situation, using the <b>native library pre-loading feature</b> is highly
        recommended.  It is available as of version 1.0.80.0 and enabled by
        default.  In order to take advantage of this feature, the separate
        managed and interop assemblies <b>must</b> be used with XCOPY deployment
        (i.e. this feature is not supported by the mixed-mode assembly, nor when
        the assembly is deployed to the global assembly cache), resulting in an
        application deployment that looks something like this:

    Templates (1), (2), (3), and (4) are used for source-code packages.
    Templates (1) and (3) are used for generic source-code packages and
    templates (2) and (4) are used for source-code packages that are generally
    only useful on unix-like platforms.  Templates (3) and (4) are used for
    source-code packages that include the extra files needed to run the unit
    test suite.
  </p>

  <p>
    Templates (5) and (6) are used for the setup packages.  Template (6) is
    used for the setup package containing the mixed-mode assembly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Templates (7) and (8) are used for the precompiled binary packages.
    Template (8) is used for the precompiled binary package containing the
    mixed-mode assembly.  Templates (9) and (10) are used for the precompiled
    binary packages statically linked to the Visual C++ runtime.  Template (10)
    is used for the precompiled binary package containing the mixed-mode
    assembly statically linked to the Visual C++ runtime.
  </p>

  <p>
    Templates (11) and (12) are used for unofficial pre-release
    &quot;snapshots&quot; of source code.
