        All the &quot;bundle&quot; packages contain the

        <br /><br />
        All the &quot;static&quot; packages contain either native or mixed-mode
        assembly binaries linked statically to the appropriate version of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C++">Visual C++</a>
        runtime.  Typically, these packages are used in cases where customer
        machines may not have the necessary version of the Visual C++ runtime
        installed and it cannot be installed due to limited privileges.
        <br /><br />
        The next step is to identify the version of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">.NET Framework</a>
        being targeted by the application.
        Generally, assembly binaries linked against the

        assemblies linked against the .NET Framework 4.0 (or higher)
        <b>cannot</b> be loaded by any versions of the .NET Framework prior to
        4.0.

        The final step is to identify the target processor architecture on both
        the development and customer machines.  Generally,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86">x86</a> binaries will work on
        an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X64">x64</a> machine running
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows">Windows</a> (using
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WoW64">WoW64</a>).  However, there
        is a problem when using managed code.  If the executable that starts the
        process consists entirely of managed code, it will run with the native
        processor architecture of the machine, which will be x64 on an x64
        machine.  Later on, this will cause assemblies containing any native
        code compiled for x86 (e.g. the &quot;System.Data.SQLite.dll&quot;
        mixed-mode assembly, the &quot;SQLite.Interop.dll&quot; native interop
        assembly, or the &quot;sqlite3.dll&quot; native library) to fail to
        load, typically resulting in a
        <a href="faq.wiki#q12">BadImageFormatException</a> being thrown.
        <br /><br />
        If the development and customer machines may have different processor
        architectures, more than one binary package may be required.  For this
        situation, using the <b>native library pre-loading feature</b> is highly
        recommended.  It is available as of version 1.0.80.0 and enabled by
        default.  In order to take advantage of this feature, the separate
        managed and interop assemblies <b>must</b> be used with XCOPY deployment
        (i.e. this feature is not supported by the mixed-mode assembly, nor when
        the assembly is deployed to the global assembly cache), resulting in an
        application deployment that looks something like this:

    used for generic source-code packages and template (2) is used for
    source-code packages that are generally only useful on unix-like platforms.
    Template (3) is used for the setup package.  Template (4) is used for the
    setup package containing the mixed-mode assembly.  Template (5) is used for
    the precompiled binary package.  Template (6) is used for the precompiled
    binary package containing the mixed-mode assembly.  Template (7) is used for
    the precompiled binary package statically linked to the Visual C++ runtime.
    Template (8) is used for the precompiled binary package containing the
    mixed-mode assembly statically linked to the Visual C++ runtime.  Template
    (9) is used for unofficial pre-release &quot;snapshots&quot; of source code.
    Templates (10) and (11) are used for the official NuGet packages.
